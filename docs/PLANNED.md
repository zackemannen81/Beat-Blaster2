# Planned Features and Future Considerations

This document outlines planned features and future considerations for Beat Blaster 2.

## Gameplay

- **Endless Mode:** A game mode that loops selected segments of a track, with increasing difficulty over time.
- **Daily Track:** A pre-determined track and seed for a daily challenge with a global leaderboard that resets every 24 hours.
- **Custom Song Import:** Allow players to import their own music files and have the game generate a beat map for them.
- **Difficulty Modifiers:** Add modifiers such as "No-hit", "Iron Mode", and "Double-time" to the game.
- **Replays:** Allow players to save and watch replays of their runs.
- **Cosmetics:** Add unlockable cosmetics such as trails and skins.

## Power-ups

- **Overdrive:** A new power-up that increases the player's damage and fire rate for a short period of time.

## UI/UX

- **Tutorial:** A tutorial to introduce new players to the game's mechanics.
- **Practice Mode:** A mode that allows players to practice specific sections of a track.

## Technical

- **Telemetry:** Instrument telemetry for beat accuracy, session length, crash reporting, and drop-off reasons.
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** Use performance metrics (hit rate, misses) to dynamically skip or downgrade waves mid-run.
- **Seeded Wave Generation:** Use a deterministic wave generation algorithm to ensure that the same seed always produces the same wave sequence.
