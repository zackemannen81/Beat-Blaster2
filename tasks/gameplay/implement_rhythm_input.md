# Implement Rhythm Input

**Task:** Implement the core rhythm input mechanic.

**Description:**

Players must be able to press keys in time with on-screen prompts that are synchronized to the music. This task involves:

- Creating a system for handling player input (e.g., keyboard events).
- Defining the timing windows for different accuracy levels (e.g., Perfect, Great, Good, Miss).
- Comparing the player's input time with the on-screen prompts' timing.
- Providing immediate feedback to the player based on their accuracy.
