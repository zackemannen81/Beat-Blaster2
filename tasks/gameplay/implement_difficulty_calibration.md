# Implement Difficulty Calibration

**Task ID:** GAMEPLAY-004

**Description:**

Build a comprehensive difficulty calibration workflow so players can tune the game before playing. The work should cover:

- Latency calibration flow in Options, including audio/visual feedback and persistence.
- Difficulty tuning tools that adjust scroll speed, spawn density, and enemy HP based on calibration results.
- A short guided experience (preview track or scripted segment) that demonstrates the impact of calibration choices.
- Telemetry or logging hooks to help evaluate calibration effectiveness and guide future adjustments.
