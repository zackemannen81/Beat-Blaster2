# Rework Bomb into Beat-Synced Ultimate

**Task ID:** GAMEPLAY-017

**Status:** OPEN

**Description:**

Redesign the bomb mechanic to charge via combo performance, detonate on-beat for amplified effects, and provide synchronized audio/visual climaxes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Bomb meter fills through Perfect/Good hits and grants bonus charge from abilities.
- Activating on a Perfect beat increases radius/damage; off-beat triggers reduced effect and feedback.
- Bomb activation triggers screenwide VFX/SFX aligned to music peaks without frame drops.
