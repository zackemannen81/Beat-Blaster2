# Enhance Powerup Visibility

**Task ID:** GAMEPLAY-005

**Description:**

Add a small text label beneath dropped power-up sprites so players can quickly distinguish pickups from enemies during hectic sequences. Ensure the label integrates with existing HUD styling, adapts for different power-up types, and respects reduced-motion/high-contrast settings.
