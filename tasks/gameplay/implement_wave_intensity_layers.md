# Implement Wave Intensity Layers

**Task ID:** GAMEPLAY-019

**Status:** OPEN

**Description:**

Extend the wave system with beat-driven intensity layers (low/mid/high) that adjust spawn patterns, enemy behavior, and environmental pressure based on track sections and player performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Wave definitions support intensity metadata and conditional spawns.
- Runtime switches layers when music or difficulty cues demand it, with smooth transitions.
- Telemetry confirms layer shifts align with soundtrack structure and combo state.
