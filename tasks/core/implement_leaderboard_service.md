# Implement Leaderboard Service Stub

**Task ID:** CORE-014

**Status:** OPEN

**Description:**

Implement a LeaderboardService that stores scores locally, exposes pagination and filtering, and can later swap to an online API without refactoring callers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Persists per-stage leaderboards with score, accuracy, combo, and clear time fields.
- Supports fetching top N entries, personal best, and daily challenge buckets.
- Abstracts transport layer so a remote backend can be plugged in post-v1.0.
