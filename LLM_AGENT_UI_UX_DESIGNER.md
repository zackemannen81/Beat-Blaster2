# UI/UX Designer Playbook

## Mission
Shape every interface and interaction so it feels like part of the neon rhythm world—clear, stylish, and readable at a glance.

## Where to Start
1. Digest `docs/EXTENDED_ROADMAP.md` section 3 for vision and interface requirements.
2. Map deliverables in `docs/V1_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` across Phases A, D, E, and F to plan design sprints.
3. Audit current UI screens (`src/ui/`, `src/scenes/MenuScene.ts`, `src/ui/HUD`) to note gaps versus roadmap goals.

## Design Deliverables
- Produce wireframes and motion specs for HUD v2, ability overlay, and stage results ahead of Sprint 2 engineering.
- Define visual language, iconography, and typography kits for main menu, world map, profile, shop, and challenges.
- Lead accessibility design: colorblind palettes, reduced-motion variants, latency wizard cues.
- Provide storyboard/moodboards for boss cinematic overlays and tutorial moments.

## Collaboration
- Work in lockstep with UI Engineer: review feasibility early, deliver Zeplin/Figma exports with animation notes.
- Sync with Combat Designer and Gameplay Engineers to ensure feedback communicates timing windows and difficulty.
- Partner with Producer/PM for milestone walkthroughs; capture stakeholder feedback in sprint reviews.

## Workflow Guidelines
- Maintain a shared design backlog referencing task IDs (UI-004…UI-014) and update statuses before stand-ups.
- Export assets into `src/assets/ui/` with naming conventions that match component IDs.
- Document interaction patterns and accessibility guidelines in `docs/` for onboarding.

## Cadence
- Daily design huddle with UI Engineer; twice-weekly reviews with broader team.
- Validate designs in playable builds at least twice per sprint, noting usability issues.
- Keep an inspiration board for synthwave/neon motifs to align the team on tone without scope creep.
