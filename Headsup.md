⚠ Heads up, you've used over 90% of your 5h limit. Run /status for a breakdown.

• I'll compile a clear summary of the six key steps taken, highlighting updates
  in calibration wizard docs and the new design doc, and detail file modifications
  involving the overlay ability, HUD, various scenes, and services. I’ll include
  instructions referencing file paths and mention the calibration scene explicitly
  to wrap up neatly with bullet points for clarity.

> - Integrated profile persistence scaffold: src/systems/SaveService.ts:1
  now handles versioned profile saves with rolling backups, and src/systems/
  ProfileService.ts:65 auto-loads/auto-saves profiles, records run stats, and emits
  profile change events consumed throughout the UI.
  - Refreshed player UI: src/scenes/ProfileScene.ts:12 lists profiles with create/
  rename/delete controls and shows stats/achievements; src/scenes/MenuScene.ts:18
  displays the active profile name; src/scenes/ResultScene.ts:20 records score/
  kills/achievements into ProfileService and reuses the profile name for leaderboard
  entries.
  - HUD v2 upgrades: src/ui/AbilityOverlay.ts:1 and src/ui/HUD.ts:91 add the
  BeatCoin tracker plus an ability overlay that shows bomb charge, cooldown arcs,
  and tier badges, with sample ability states driven by src/scenes/GameScene.ts:96.
  - Latency calibration wizard shipped: src/scenes/LatencyCalibrationScene.ts:1
  provides countdown/sampling/preview flow using RhythmRing and LatencyService; src/
  scenes/OptionsScene.ts:18 exposes “Calibrate Latency…” in the menu.

  Build: npm run build (≈33 s) succeeds with existing Vite asset-size warnings
  only. Journal and design docs updated (docs/dev-journal.md:169, docs/design/
  phaseA_hud_v2.md:1, docs/design/phaseA_latency_wizard.md:1); agent notes
  refreshed (LLM_AGENT_UI_ENGINEER.md:38, LLM_AGENT_SENIOR_CORE_ENGINEER.md:44,
  LLM_AGENT_GAMEPLAY_ENGINEER.md:41).

  Next steps:

  1. Polish the calibration wizard visuals/confirmation, and surface manual save
  indicators in settings.
  2. Hook profile management into other menus (quick switch) and replace remaining
  localStorage fallback code (e.g., leaderboard prompts).
  3. Add QA coverage for SaveService/ProfileService, RhythmRing/AbilityOverlay
  rendering, and latency sampling logic.


  You’re taking over the Beat-Blaster2 project mid-sprint. Please review the recent
  changes and continue Phase A work.

  Context:
  - Repo: Beat-Blaster2 (Phaser + TypeScript)
  - Recent work (already implemented):
    * BeatClock/EventBus integration, combo/scoring updates.
    * SaveService + ProfileService for profile persistence; Menu/Result/Profile
  scenes now use it.
    * HUD v2 upgrades (RhythmRing, BeatCoin tracker, ability overlay); ability
  overlay currently driven by stubbed cooldowns in GameScene.
    * LatencyCalibrationScene wired into Options via “Calibrate Latency…”.

  Where to look:
  - `docs/dev-journal.md` (entries 08:05 and earlier).
  - Design docs: `docs/design/phaseA_core_systems.md`, `phaseA_latency_service.md`,
  `phaseA_hud_v2.md`, `phaseA_profile_service.md`, `phaseA_latency_wizard.md`.
  - Key files: `src/systems/SaveService.ts`, `ProfileService.ts`,
  `LatencyService.ts`, `ui/HUD.ts`, `ui/AbilityOverlay.ts`, `scenes/
  LatencyCalibrationScene.ts`, `ProfileScene.ts`, `ResultScene.ts`, `MenuScene.ts`,
  `OptionsScene.ts`, `GameScene.ts`.

  Current priorities (Unfinished tasks):
  1. UI-012 polish: replace dummy ability data in
  `GameScene.initializeAbilityOverlay` with real ability state once the gameplay
  ability framework is ready; refine icons/tooltips.
  2. UI-011 polish: enhance LatencyCalibrationScene visuals/feedback, add clear
  Apply/Cancel confirmations, persist applied offsets visually in Options.
  3. Profile management UI: surface quick profile switching in menus, support manual
  save indicators if needed.
  4. QA backlog: create tests for SaveService migrations/backups, ProfileService
  autosave, and RhythmRing/AbilityOverlay rendering.
  5. Remove remaining localStorage fallbacks (leaderboard prompts) in favor of
  ProfileService data.

  Build status: `npm run build` succeeds (~33s) with only known Vite asset-size
  warnings.

  Open questions / TODOs:
  - profile stats currently accumulate total score/kills/games; consider tracking
  play time & achievements more fully.
  - OptionsScene still shows raw input offset row; calibration wizard updates
  settings but UI text remains static until rerender.
  - Latency wizard countdown/sampling visuals need design polish.

  Please continue from here, keep logging in `docs/dev-journal.md`, and update the
  relevant `LLM_AGENT_*` files when you make progress.
