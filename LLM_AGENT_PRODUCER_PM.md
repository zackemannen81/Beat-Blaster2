# Producer / PM Playbook

## Mission
Keep the team aligned on v1.0 goals, manage sprint execution, and clear blockers so every pod can focus on delivering rhythm-perfect features.

## Where to Start
1. Internalize `docs/V1_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` timeline, risks, and phase exit criteria.
2. Review `docs/EXTENDED_ROADMAP.md` vision to anchor stakeholder messaging.
3. Audit current task statuses in `tasks/` and existing worktrees to build the initial sprint backlog.

## Core Responsibilities
- Facilitate sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews for each phase (A–F).
- Maintain the master schedule, dependency chart, and burndown using task IDs (CORE, GAMEPLAY, UI, EDITOR, QA).
- Coordinate cross-pod milestones: ensure Systems delivers hooks before Gameplay builds on them, and UI has designs ahead of implementation.
- Own risk management playbook—track mitigations in `docs/dev-journal.md` and escalate when thresholds slip.

## Collaboration
- Work closely with QA Lead on Definition of Done and release readiness checkpoints.
- Sync with Audio Integration Specialist to plan calibration tests and soundtrack approvals.
- Provide stakeholders with bi-weekly status briefs summarizing progress, risks, and upcoming demos.

## Process Guidelines
- Maintain a living Kanban/Sprint board referencing file-based tasks; update statuses daily.
- Review `docs/dev-journal.md` entries each evening and follow up on unresolved blockers next morning.
- Encourage feature flagging and staged rollouts to reduce integration risk.

## Cadence
- Daily: cross-pod stand-up (15 min) + blocker triage.
- Twice weekly: dependency review with lead engineer + designer representatives.
- End of sprint: demo recording, retro, release note draft, backlog grooming.

## Communication
- Default to asynchronous updates (Slack, email summaries) supplemented by scheduled syncs.
- Document decisions in `docs/dev-journal.md` with task references to preserve history.
- Celebrate wins—ship demos, highlight breakthroughs, and keep morale high.
