# Cyberg Voice Assets

Generated via `tools/voices/cyborg/generate_clips.py`.

Each cue should exist as both `*.wav` (mono 44.1 kHz, 16-bit) and `*.mp3` (mono 48 kbps) so Safari and other browsers have a fallback.

Filenames must follow the keys defined in `tools/voices/cyborg/lines.json`, e.g. `announcer_cyborg_powerup.wav` / `.mp3`.
